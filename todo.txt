Real support for subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  Subrange on local/output is a suggested invariant?

Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts?
  What do asserts in subnodes mean?

Additional static checks
  No unguarded pres?
  No alegbraic loops?
