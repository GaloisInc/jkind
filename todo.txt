Support constants better
  Don't inline right away since it will ruin error messages
  Check for shadowing

Real support for subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  Subrange on local/output is a suggested invariant?

Static checks
  Typing
  Single variable declaration
  All locals & outputs assigned
  All properties unique
  No non-linearities
  No unguarded pres?
  No alegbraic loops?

Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts? (not compatible with pkind since theirs are broken)
