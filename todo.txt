Add proved properties back as invariants?

Have failure of one process cause failure of others


Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Static checks: typing, single variable declaration, all outputs assigned, properties unique,
  no unguarded pres?, no alegbraic loops?, no non-linearities

Support for subranges

Support for asserts? (not compatible with Kind since theirs are broken)

Handle missing values for variables

Reduce decimals (1.0000000 becomes huge fraction)
