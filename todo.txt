Check for cyclic node calls
Allow parens around multiple lhs

Real support for subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  Subrange on local/output is a suggested invariant?

Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts?

Additional static checks
  No unguarded pres?
  No alegbraic loops?
