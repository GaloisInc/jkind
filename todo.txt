Support constants better
  Don't inline right away since it will ruin error messages
  Check for shadowing

Support for subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  What is subrange on local/output? What if you violate it?

Static checks: typing, single variable declaration, all outputs assigned, properties unique,
  no unguarded pres?, no alegbraic loops?, no non-linearities



Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts? (not compatible with pkind since theirs are broken)
