Static checks
  All properties unique
  No non-linearities
  No unguarded pres?
  No alegbraic loops?

Real support for subranges
  Allow negative numbers in subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  Subrange on local/output is a suggested invariant?

Handle multi node if they are simple

Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts? (not compatible with pkind since theirs are broken)
