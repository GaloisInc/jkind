Handle mutli nodes with multiple return values

Real support for subranges
  Subrange on input is an assert
  Subrange on local/output is a suggested invariant?

Advanced invariant generation (need some examples)

Differentiate unknown results (max iterations, timeout, failure) 

Support for asserts? (not compatible with pkind since theirs are broken)

Additional static checks
  No unguarded pres?
  No alegbraic loops?
